# User Interface

User interface is the user facing side of the Shiny application. 

It contains various display elements such as titlePanel, sidebarLayout, radioButtons, tabPanel etc. Following steps show how we step-wise buit up code for UI.

## Importing necessary libraries

```
library(shiny)
library(leaflet)
library(shinyWidgets)
```
 
## Creating display elements

Now that we have imported libraries, we start adding code inside fluidPage to create display elements. 'titlePanel' gives the heading, mainPanel

```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
    HTML(html_fix),
    titlePanel("NYC Real Estate and Crime"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(),
        mainPanel(
            leafletOutput(
                "map",
                width="100%",
                height="90vh"
            )
        ),
        position="left"
    )
))
```   

## Creating tabsetPanel and tabPanel







```
print("test")
```

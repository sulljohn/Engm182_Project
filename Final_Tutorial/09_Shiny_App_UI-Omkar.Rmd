# User Interface

User interface is the user facing side of the Shiny application. It contains various display elements such as titlePanel, sidebarLayout, radioButtons, tabPanel etc. Following steps show step-wise buid up for UI.

#### Importing necessary libraries


library(shiny)
library(leaflet)
library(shinyWidgets)

#### Creating display elements

Now that we have imported libraries, we start adding code inside fluidpage to create display elements. 'titlePanel' gives the heading, mainPanel

```
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
shinyUI(fluidPage(
    HTML(html_fix),
    titlePanel("NYC Real Estate and Crime"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(),
        mainPanel(
            leafletOutput(
                "map",
                width="100%",
                height="90vh"
            )
        ),
        position="left"
    )
))
```   





```
print("test")

```
```
```


# Section 2

Other code test (or code that we do not want to run):

```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
